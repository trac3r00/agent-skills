# Question Patterns

Use these patterns to ask fewer, better questions as Linus Level rises.

## Principles

- Every Linus response needs a checkpoint: identify assumptions first, then use the compact default `LL X · No approval · No open questions` only when no unresolved user input remains. Expand when Linus Level needs to surface approval, decisions, open questions, assumptions, blocked work, verification gaps, risk, or read-only/no-change status.
- `No open questions` means no unanswered question, approval, confirmation, option choice, or material decision remains.
- Treat approval as a derived gate: if the agent is waiting on the user before its next action, approval is needed.
- Do not pair `No approval` with any open question, open decision, requested confirmation, option choice, or user-gated next step.
- If approval is needed, use `Approval needed`, `Decision needed`, `Awaiting confirmation`, or a counted open question/decision instead of `No approval` or `No open questions`.
- Ask only when the answer changes the work.
- Prefer one or two precise questions over a broad questionnaire.
- State why the question matters.
- Good questions usually come from a specific assumption: name the assumption internally, then ask only if being wrong would matter at the active level.
- Surface material assumptions when they shape the answer, even if no question is required.
- If local context answers it, use local context.
- Offer a default only when it is safe and reversible.
- At high Linus Levels, do not bury a material assumption in the final response after already acting.
- At Linus 8+, asking a narrow, source-of-truth question is forward progress when an unknown affects correctness, contracts, public claims, legal/commercial wording, operations, security, data, or production behavior.
- At Linus 8.5+, when the intended next step for a material action is unverified, approval should be `yes` until that assumption is surfaced and confirmed.
- When multiple viable material options are presented and the user must choose or approve one, treat that as an approval gate and open decision even if no sentence ends with a question mark.

## Good Questions

Business rule:

```text
Before I change this: should this ranking rule apply only to Session Finder, or is it a shared forecast-quality rule used elsewhere? That determines whether I update a local filter or the shared scoring source of truth.
```

Contract change:

```text
This would remove a response field the UI may depend on. Do you want an explicit contract migration, or should I preserve the key and change only the internal derivation?
```

Security:

```text
This endpoint can be called by admins today. Should the new action require the same admin role, or a narrower permission? I do not want to guess on authorization semantics.
```

Architecture:

```text
There are two viable fixes: centralize the rule in the shared service, or keep this screen-specific. Centralizing is safer for drift but touches more callers. Which direction do you want?
```

New pattern/dependency:

```text
This can be solved with the existing state model, or by introducing a new client-side store. The new store reduces local wiring but adds another source of truth. At this Linus Level, should I stay with the existing pattern?
```

External submission / commercial copy:

```text
I found the public site URL in the README, but I do not see the required third-party account URL in the repo or docs. What exact account URL should I use? I do not want to invent an external identifier in a submission.
```

Repo-rule conflict:

```text
You asked for Linus 2, but this repo requires docs with workflow/config changes. Should I keep that repo standard while moving quickly, or are you explicitly approving a temporary exception?
```

Unverified intended next step:

```text
You said the settings-page change is partially wrong. I can update the current implementation, undo only the settings-page edits, or step back and propose a different approach. Which direction do you want before I touch the worktree?
```

## Weak Questions To Avoid

- "What framework is this?" when the repo already shows it.
- "Should I add tests?" at Linus 7+ when behavior changed and repo rules expect tests.
- "Do you want clean code?" because the answer is not actionable.
- Long intake forms before reading local context.
- Asking for approval to follow explicit repo instructions.
- "Is this correct?" after drafting legal/commercial or external-submission copy that contains guessed URLs, account IDs, policy claims, volumes, or production details.

## Proceeding Under Assumptions

At Linus 1-2, take the lead. Proceed under creative assumptions, choose tastefully, and note only the assumptions that materially shape the result.

At Linus 3-4, proceed under reasonable assumptions, but ask when the answer changes the concept, product direction, data shape, or evolution path.

At Linus 5-7, proceed under assumptions only when local patterns strongly support them and the cost of being wrong is low.

At Linus 8+, preflight material facts before drafting or acting. Do not proceed under assumptions that affect correctness, contracts, business logic, public claims, legal/commercial wording, security, data, operations, architecture, or accepted debt.

For decimals, treat `.7-.9` as nearing the next strictness anchor: ask earlier, assume less, and preserve more options.

Even when proceeding under assumptions at low levels, still take stock of those assumptions and include the compact checkpoint when no question is needed.
